# Life Light Legacy:

This a blog about life as we feel it. We write about everything that touches and moves us.   The words come directly from our hearts and the purpose is to inspire. Lightening up lives through sharing ours is our life’s work.

## The Authors

### Subu:

I’m someone who loves writing, reading, intimately connecting with people, observing life and participating in it, cooking, eating good food, listening to soulful music, writing code, meditating, traveling to new places, nature and my family.

### Akila :

I am the better half and pretty much love most things mentioned by the husband. I have a food blog which goes by the name morphyandme.com. Baking helped me start my blogging journey, which in turn opened up the world of photography. My love for travel and my DSLR gives me so much more to talk about.
